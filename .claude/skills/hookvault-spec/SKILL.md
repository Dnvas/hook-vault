# HookVault — Product Specification

This is the canonical source of truth for HookVault's product requirements.
Read this end-to-end before planning or implementing any feature.

## What HookVault is

A .NET 8 open-source developer tool. Generic, provider-agnostic webhook
capture / inspection / replay engine for local development environments.

Runs as a single Docker container alongside any project's dev stack and acts
as a transparent pass-through proxy that records every webhook event for
debugging and replay.

**Distribution target:** any developer working with webhooks (Stripe, GitHub,
Twilio, Resend, anything) should be able to add HookVault to their
docker-compose, drop in a config file, and have full capture + replay working
in under a minute.

## What HookVault does

1. Receives incoming webhooks from any provider via dynamically registered routes.
2. Optionally validates HMAC signatures based on provider-specific configuration
   (no hardcoded provider logic — purely config-driven).
3. Stores the full event (headers, body, signature validation result with debug
   info, timestamp, provider name).
4. Forwards the event to the configured local destination URL (transparent
   pass-through).
5. Provides a JWT-protected management API to browse, filter, inspect, and
   replay captured events.
6. Replays events asynchronously via a background worker with retry logic and
   exponential backoff.
7. Optionally exposes a Prometheus scraping endpoint at `/metrics`
   (unauthenticated; metrics are operational data).
8. Supports a per-provider "capture-only" mode (`captureOnly: true`)
   that persists events without forwarding, with the resting state
   `EventStatus.Captured`.
9. Supports body-edit replay: tweak the captured payload in the UI
   and replay with the edited body without mutating the stored event.

## Core design principles

- **Provider-agnostic** — zero knowledge of Stripe, Resend, or any service.
  All provider behaviour comes from the user's config file.
- **Zero-friction setup** — single Docker container, SQLite by default
  (no external DB needed). PostgreSQL supported as an optional upgrade.
- **Config-driven** — each project supplies its own `hookvault.json` defining
  providers, validation schemes, and forwarding URLs.
- **Transparent pass-through** — to the target app, the webhook looks identical
  to receiving it directly. HookVault just records it along the way.

## Provider configuration schema

Each project supplies a `hookvault.json` mounted into the container. Read on
startup; dynamically registers ingest routes.

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "stripe",
      "path": "/stripe",
      "forwardUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:54321/functions/v1/stripe-webhook",
      "captureOnly": false,
      "validation": {
        "algorithm": "hmac-sha256",
        "secretEnvVar": "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
        "signatureHeader": "Stripe-Signature",
        "payloadFormat": "{timestamp}.{body}",
        "signatureEncoding": "hex",
        "signaturePattern": "v1={signature}",
        "timestampPattern": "t={timestamp}"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "resend",
      "path": "/resend",
      "forwardUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:54321/functions/v1/resend-webhook",
      "validation": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Field descriptions:

- `name` — human-readable provider label, used for filtering and display
- `path` — ingest route registered dynamically (POST /api/ingest/{path})
- `forwardUrl` — where to proxy the event in the local dev environment
- `captureOnly` — boolean (default `false`). When `true`, the event is
  persisted with status `Captured` and **not** forwarded. Users can
  trigger replays manually whenever the downstream is ready.
- `validation` — nullable; when null, skip validation and just capture + forward
- `validation.algorithm` — HMAC algorithm (`hmac-sha1`, `hmac-sha256` (default),
  `hmac-sha512`). SHA-1 is for legacy schemes (GitHub `X-Hub-Signature`,
  Twitter, some Eventbrite providers).
- `validation.secretEnvVar` — env var name holding the secret
  (**not** the secret itself — secrets never go in the config file)
- `validation.signatureHeader` — request header containing the signature
- `validation.payloadFormat` — how the signed string is constructed
  (`{body}` = raw request body, `{timestamp}` = extracted timestamp)
- `validation.signatureEncoding` — how the computed HMAC digest is encoded:
  `"hex"` (lowercase hex, default when omitted or null), `"base64"` (standard
  Base64 with padding), `"base64url"` (URL-safe Base64, no padding). Unknown
  values return a validation error. Hex comparison is case-insensitive;
  base64/base64url comparisons are case-sensitive.
- `validation.signaturePattern` — how to extract the signature from the header
  value (e.g. Stripe puts it after `v1=`). Omit or set null if the entire
  header value is the digest.
- `validation.timestampPattern` — how to extract the timestamp from the header
  value (nullable, for providers that include a timestamp)

## Tech stack

- .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core (SQLite default, PostgreSQL optional)
- `System.Threading.Channels` for the internal replay queue (`Channel<T>`,
  producer/consumer pattern)
- JWT authentication on the management API endpoints
- Swagger / OpenAPI via Swashbuckle
- Docker (single-container, multi-stage build)
- GitHub Actions CI (build, test, format check)
- xUnit for unit tests

## Database

- SQLite default at `/data/hookvault.db` (configurable via `SQLITE_PATH`,
  mountable as a Docker volume).
- PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` env var is set with a connection string.
- Provider selection happens in `Program.cs` based on env presence; no
  code changes required between modes.

## Dynamic route registration

On startup, read the provider config file and register
`POST /api/ingest/{providerPath}` for each provider. Use a single
`IngestController` that resolves the provider config from the route parameter.
If a request hits a path with no configured provider, return 404.

## Generic HMAC signature validation

The `SignatureValidator` must:

- Read the signature from the header specified in config (`signatureHeader`)
- Extract the actual signature value using `signaturePattern`
- Extract the timestamp if `timestampPattern` is specified
- Construct the payload string using `payloadFormat`
  (replacing `{body}` with raw body and `{timestamp}` with extracted timestamp)
- Compute HMAC using the configured algorithm and the secret from the env var
- Encode the computed digest per `signatureEncoding`: `"hex"` (default/null),
  `"base64"`, or `"base64url"`. Unknown values throw `NotSupportedException`,
  caught by the outer try/catch and returned as a validation error.
- Compare using constant-time comparison
  (`CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals`)
- Return a detailed result: `isValid`, `computedSignature`, `receivedSignature`,
  `payloadUsed`, `extractedTimestamp`, `algorithmUsed` — so when validation
  fails, the developer can see EXACTLY what went wrong

## Event forwarding

After capturing, immediately forward to the provider's `forwardUrl` using
`HttpClient` (from `IHttpClientFactory`). The named `"forwarder"` client's
`HttpClient.Timeout` is configurable via `HOOKVAULT_FORWARD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
(default 30, accepted range 1-300). Invalid or out-of-range values log
a warning at startup and fall back to the 30-second default. The .NET stock
default of 100s would block the single-reader replay worker for ~7 minutes
per unreachable target across 4 attempts. Preserve the original request body.
Forward original headers but add:

- `X-HookVault-Event-Id`
- `X-HookVault-Provider`

Store the forward result (status code, success/failure, error message) on the
event record. If forwarding fails, mark as `ForwardFailed` — **don't auto-retry
on initial forward**. Retry is the replay system's job.

## Replay system

**Internal machinery (Phase 2 — DONE):**
- `ReplayQueue` — singleton `Channel<ReplayJob>` wrapper. Exposes `EnqueueAsync(Guid)`,
  `EnqueueWithBodyAsync(Guid, byte[])`, and `Reader`. `Channel.CreateBounded(10_000)`
  with `SingleReader = true` and `FullMode = Wait` (callers backpressure via `await`).
- `ReplayWorker` — `BackgroundService` that drains the channel via `ReadAllAsync`.
  Per item: creates a DI scope (`IServiceScopeFactory`), resolves `EventRepository`
  and `EventForwarder`, sets status to `Replaying`, then calls `EventForwarder.SendAsync`
  (the pure HTTP method — no DB touches).
  - 4 total attempts: 1 initial + 3 retries with delays `[1s, 2s, 4s]`.
  - Retry eligibility: 5xx responses, network errors, and timeouts are retriable.
    4xx responses are non-retriable EXCEPT 408 (Request Timeout), 425 (Too Early),
    and 429 (Too Many Requests), which remain retriable. Retry timing
    `[1s, 2s, 4s] × 3` is unchanged for retriable failures; non-retriable
    failures short-circuit to `ReplayFailed` after the first attempt.
  - On success: sets `Forwarded`, records `ForwardedAt` + `ForwardStatusCode`.
  - On exhaustion: sets `ReplayFailed`. Final DB write uses `CancellationToken.None`
    to prevent orphaned `Replaying` rows on graceful shutdown.
  - Increments `ReplayCount` once per replay trigger (not per HTTP attempt).
- `EventForwarder.SendAsync` — `internal` pure HTTP method extracted from `ForwardAsync`.
  Returns `ForwardResult(bool Success, int? StatusCode, string? Error)`. No DB touches.
  Shared by both the ingest path (`ForwardAsync`) and the replay path (`ReplayWorker`).

**HTTP endpoints (Phase 3 — DONE):**
- `POST /api/events/{id}/replay` — enqueues a single event into `ReplayQueue`.
- `POST /api/events/replay-failed` — bulk-enqueues all `ForwardFailed` events.
Both are JWT-protected via `[Authorize]` on `EventsController`.

## Health endpoint (public, no auth)

`GET /api/health` returns:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "providers": ["stripe", "resend"],
  "database": "sqlite",
  "eventCount": 142,
  "oldestEvent": "2026-05-10T08:30:00Z",
  "retention": {
    "maxEvents": 10000,
    "retentionDays": 7,
    "lastSweepAt": "2026-05-16T13:00:00Z",
    "lastSweepDeleted": 3
  }
}
```

`retention` is `null` when no caps are configured.

## Metrics endpoint (public, no auth)

`GET /metrics` returns Prometheus-format text with both built-in
AspNetCore HTTP metrics and HookVault's custom instruments:

- `hookvault_events_total{provider, status}` — counter
- `hookvault_replays_total{outcome}` — counter; `outcome` is one of
  `"success"`, `"retry"` (incremented once per non-final retriable failure
  before the next backoff delay), or `"exhausted"`
- `hookvault_forward_duration_seconds{provider, outcome}` — histogram
- `hookvault_retention_deleted_total{reason}` — counter
- `hookvault_signature_validation_total{provider, result}` — counter

Unauthenticated by design — metrics are operational data, not secrets.
The threat model assumes HookVault is not exposed to the public internet.

## Management API — JWT protected

- `GET /api/events` — list events; filterable by `provider`, `status`,
  `from`, `to`, `bodyContains` (case-insensitive substring on raw body),
  and `providerEventId` (exact match on the extracted provider event id).
  Paginated with `limit`/`offset`.
- `GET /api/events/{id}` — full event detail including headers, body,
  validation debug info, forward result.
- `GET /api/events/stream` — Server-Sent Events stream of new captures
  and status transitions, used by the React UI. Because the browser
  `EventSource` API cannot set an `Authorization` header, this route
  accepts the JWT via the `?token=<jwt>` query string in addition to
  the normal bearer header. The query-string fallback is scoped to
  this route only (see `JwtBearerEvents.OnMessageReceived` in
  `Program.cs`).
- `POST /api/events/{id}/replay` — enqueue single event for replay.
  Optional JSON body `{ "body": "..." }` replays with the supplied
  payload without mutating the stored event.
- `POST /api/events/replay-failed` — bulk replay all failed events.
- `DELETE /api/events` — clear captured events
  (optional `?provider=stripe` filter). Requires `?confirm=true`;
  without it, returns `400` with code `delete_confirm_required`
  and deletes nothing.

### Auth opt-out

`HOOKVAULT_NO_AUTH=true` disables JWT enforcement on the management API.
A loud startup warning is logged. Intended for single-user local dev
where the listener is bound to `127.0.0.1`. Do not enable in any
environment where the listener is reachable from outside the host.

When `HOOKVAULT_NO_AUTH=true`, `HOOKVAULT_JWT_SECRET` becomes optional.
If unset, `JwtOptions.Ephemeral()` generates a 48-byte random key per
process — the JWT bearer scheme stays registered so callers presenting
a token (e.g. SSE clients using the startup-printed dev token) still
authenticate, while the default policy passes for everyone. Tokens
minted before a restart will not validate against the new ephemeral
key.

### Startup validation

`HookVaultOptions.Validate` fails fast (exit code `1`, one-line error,
no stack trace) on:

- invalid `validation.algorithm` (not in `hmac-sha1` / `hmac-sha256` /
  `hmac-sha512`, case-insensitive),
- missing `validation.signatureHeader`,
- missing `validation.secretEnvVar`,
- malformed `hookvault.json` (`JsonException` wrapped with file path,
  line, column).

For each provider whose `validation.secretEnvVar` resolves to an unset
env var, the bootstrap logger emits a warning and startup continues —
signature validation for that provider will return an error until the
var is set.

`EventStatus`: `Received`, `Forwarding`, `Forwarded`, `ForwardFailed`,
`Replaying`, `ReplayFailed`, `Captured`.

## Example provider configs (`/examples/`)

Pure JSON with `//` comments (the config loader sets `JsonCommentHandling.Skip`
and `AllowTrailingCommas = true`). Each file is a complete, self-contained
single-provider config with explanatory comments.

- `hookvault.stripe.json` — HMAC-SHA256 hex, `{timestamp}.{body}` payload, `v1={signature}` + `t={timestamp}` patterns
- `hookvault.github.json` — HMAC-SHA256 hex, body-only, `sha256={signature}` pattern
- `hookvault.shopify.json` — HMAC-SHA256 base64 (`signatureEncoding: "base64"`), body-only, no prefix
- `hookvault.resend.json` — `"validation": null`; Svix multi-header scheme cannot be expressed in the single-header schema
- `hookvault.generic-hmac.json` — annotated template covering all algorithms, encodings, and pattern options

## Docker setup

- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimised for image size (SDK for build, ASP.NET
  runtime for final).
- Expose port 8080.
- Default SQLite DB at `/data/hookvault.db`.
- Mount config: `-v ./hookvault.json:/app/config/hookvault.json`.
- Mount data volume for SQLite persistence: `-v hookvault-data:/data`.
- `docker-compose.yml` — standalone (single container, SQLite).
- `docker-compose.postgres.yml` — optional PostgreSQL companion.

## GitHub Actions CI

- Build the solution
- Run all xUnit tests
- Check formatting (`dotnet format --verify-no-changes`)
- Build the Docker image (verify it builds, don't push)
- CodeQL security analysis on push/PR + weekly cron

## README structure (when written)

- One-line description: "Capture, inspect, and replay webhooks during local
  development"
- "Quick Start" — 3 steps to get running (create config, docker run, point
  your webhook URL at it)
- "How it works" — simple flow diagram (text-based is fine)
- "Configuration" — `hookvault.json` format
- "Provider examples" — pointing to `/examples`

### ✅ Phase 5 — Docs (DONE)

- README with the structure above
- LICENSE (AGPL-3.0)
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- `.gitattributes` enforcing LF line endings

### ✅ Phase 6 — React UI (DONE)

Full spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-phase6-react-ui-design.md`

**What was built:**
- Layout: split pane — event list left (288 px), event detail right; no navigation
- Theme: dark slate (`slate-900` bg) with indigo accents
- Detail panel: scrollable sections (Body → Headers → Validation → Forward), no tabs
- Auth: startup URL with auto-generated 30-day JWT token (`?token=` query param);
  `sessionStorage` fallback with `<TokenGate />` paste input; token stripped from
  address bar via `history.replaceState` on mount

**Backend additions (all landed):**
- `EventNotifier` singleton — `Channel<EventNotification>` for SSE fanout
- `GET /api/events/stream` — SSE endpoint; JWT accepted via `?token=` query param
  (EventSource cannot set Authorization headers)
- `Program.cs`: startup log prints full UI URL with freshly minted 30-day token
- `app.UseStaticFiles()` + `app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html")` for SPA hosting
- Dockerfile: `node:20-alpine` build stage produces `ui/dist/` → copied to `wwwroot/`
- CI: Node build + lint job added

**React stack:** Vite 6 + React 18 + TypeScript + TanStack Query v5 + Tailwind CSS v3

**Repository layout (`ui/`):**
```
ui/src/
├── api/client.ts          — fetch wrapper, injects Bearer token, handles 401
├── hooks/
│   ├── useEvents.ts       — list query + useInvalidateEvents
│   ├── useEvent.ts        — detail query + useInvalidateEvent
│   └── useEventStream.ts  — EventSource lifecycle
├── components/
│   ├── App.tsx / main.tsx
│   ├── TokenGate.tsx
│   ├── EventList.tsx      — provider + status filter pills, SSE subscription
│   ├── EventRow.tsx
│   ├── EventDetail.tsx    — panel header, Replay button
│   ├── BodySection.tsx
│   ├── HeadersSection.tsx
│   ├── ValidationSection.tsx
│   └── ForwardSection.tsx
└── types.ts               — single source of truth for API shapes
```

**Critical field name facts (traps for future agents):**
- `GET /api/events` returns `{ items: EventSummary[], total, limit, offset }`.
  The C# record property is `Items`; ASP.NET Core serializes it as `items`.
  The TypeScript type in `types.ts` uses `items` — do not rename to `events`.
- `validationDetails` is stored as raw JSON and returned as a `JsonElement?`
  inside the event detail response. It uses **camelCase** keys (`isValid`,
  `algorithmUsed`, `computedSignature`, `receivedSignature`, `payloadUsed`,
  `extractedTimestamp`, `error`) — the IngestController serializes with
  `JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase`. The TypeScript `ValidationDetails` interface
  must use camelCase to match.

**Hook stability rule (learned from Phase 6 E2E):**
- `useInvalidateEvents()` returns a `useCallback` with `[qc]` dep so the
  function reference is stable. Without this, `useEventStream`'s effect
  dep changes every render → opens/closes EventSource on every render.
- `useInvalidateEvents` invalidates **both** `['events']` (list) and
  `['event']` (all detail views). Without the second key, the detail panel
  does not refresh after the replay worker transitions a status.

### ✅ Phase 7 — Hardening sprint (DONE, v0.2.0)

Three merged PRs closing the post-Phase-6 review gaps:
- PR #17 — correctness bugs (SSE fan-out, bytes body, EF migrations, …)
- PR #18 — security hardening (JWT entropy, body cap, header redaction, …)
- PR #19 — architecture + OSS readiness (retention worker, Svix scheme, dedup, GHCR, …)

### ✅ Phase 8 — Polish + ergonomics + distribution (DONE, v0.3.0)

Three merged PRs:
- PR v0.3-1 — polish (auth opt-out, search pagination, retention surfacing)
- PR v0.3-2 — ergonomics (capture-only mode, in-UI body edit, hmac-sha1)
- PR v0.3-3 — distribution (Prometheus /metrics, multi-arch Docker, agent files committed)
